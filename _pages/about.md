Hello!

I’m driven by curiosity and a fascination with how the universe and intelligent systems work. My interests range across particle physics, artificial intelligence, hardware, and software — especially where these fields come together. I enjoy building things from the ground up, understanding systems deeply, and exploring how theory meets real-world implementation.

I am currently seeking opportunities in experimental particle physics, AI for science, and emerging quantum technologies. 

You can find more details about my background and research on my CV page.

Outside of research, I enjoy football, running, reading, doing nothing in silence, and meeting people from different backgrounds and perspectives.

Thanks for stopping by — I hope you’re on an inspiring journey of your own!
