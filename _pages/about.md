Hello!

I'm passionate about particle physics and artificial intelligence — especially where the two intersect. I'm currently exploring opportunities in experimental high-energy physics, AI for science, and quantum technologies.

At present, I’m working with researchers at INFN Padova, contributing to the MODE Collaboration by applying diffusion models to optimize detector design.

In my free time, I work on two personal projects. One is building a large language model (LLM) from scratch to deepen my understanding of modern AI systems. The other focuses on anomaly detection at the LHC, where I'm developing a Latent Diffusion model with Uncertainty-Aware Representations to help identify rare events that could signal new physics.

I completed my Master’s at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU), where I contributed to several experiments — including JUNO, HGTD, SUPAX, A2, and Belle II — and wrote my thesis on rare B-meson decays. I also completed an internship at TU Dortmund with the ATLAS experiment, working on W/Z boson tagging in 13 TeV collisions.

You can find more about my research experience on my CV page.

Outside of physics and AI, I enjoy football, running, reading, traveling, and connecting with people from diverse backgrounds.

Thanks for stopping by — I hope you're on an inspiring journey of your own!
