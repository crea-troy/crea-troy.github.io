Hello!

I'm passionate about particle physics and artificial intelligence, especially where the two intersect. I'm currently exploring exciting opportunities, including a PhD in experimental high-energy physics and AI applications in fundamental research.

Nowadays, I'm doing an internship on boosted object identification in the ATLAS experiment at TU Dortmund, with a focus on improving scale factor calibration for W/Z boson identification in 13 TeV proton-proton collisions.

I’m also working on personal projects in my free time. One project involves building a large language model (LLM) from scratch — a challenge I'm taking on to better understand the fundamentals of modern AI systems.

The second project is something I’m deeply passionate about: exploring anomaly detection in particle physics using novel architectures. I'm particularly interested in transformer-based models, hybrid classical-quantum approaches, and topological data analysis. My goal is to apply these techniques to real datasets like CERN Open Data or the LHC Olympics 2020 dataset. These ideas were sparked by reading research papers, articles, and watching lectures — and while I’m still in the early learning phase, I’m committed to building the foundational knowledge needed to turn these ideas into full research projects someday. I know it will take time, but I’m excited to make it happen.

I completed my master's studies at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU), Germany, where I worked as a research assistant on a variety of experiments such as the JUNO neutrino detector, the ATLAS High Granularity Timing Detector (HGTD), the SUPAX detector for axion searches, and the A2 Collaboration. For my master's thesis, I investigated rare B-meson decays to kaons and leptons — an FCNC process — with the Belle II Collaboration. I explain this in detail on my CV page.

Outside of physics and AI, I enjoy playing football, running, reading, traveling, and meeting new people to learn from their experiences and perspectives.

Thanks for stopping by — I hope you're having an inspiring journey of your own!
